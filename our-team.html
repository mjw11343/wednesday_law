                <h2>The Attorney</h2>
                <img src="Michael_Williams_Headshot.jpg" alt="Michael Williams Headshot" class="headshot">
                <p id="attorney-bio">Currently, Michael Williams works full-time with the <a href="https://openlawlib.org/">Open Law Library.</a> As a Codification Attorney, Williams works with governments to publish their legal materials, like codes, resolutions, and cases. While deeply passionate about his day job, Williams is dedicated to using his education to better the community, and help the people. Wednesday Law is the firm to help Attorney Williams to achieve these goals.</p>
                <p id="attorney-bio">Attorney Williams focuses his practice on supporting individuals with their legal issues. Whether the issue is regarding business and estate planning or family and custody issues, Williams provides legal guidance to support the individual as a whole. Additionally, Williams is dedicated to uplifting Indigenous communities and peoples. Indigenous peoples face a miriad of legal issues, on top of 'regular' legal processes. Williams provides legal services through an Indigenous lens to address any issues facing Indigenous peoples.</p>
                <p id="attorney-bio">Attorney Williams earned his J.D. degree from the University of Wisconsin Law School. Williams sought out unique experiences to build a diverse legal education. In summer after his first-year of law school, Williams worked with the <a href="https://www.ailc-inc.org/plsi/">Pre-Law Summer Institute (PLSI)</a> teaching incoming law students the basics of Civil Procedure, Constitutional Law, and Federal Indian Law. His second year of law school, Williams worked with the UW Law School Family Court Clinic, and Family Legal Advocacy and Support Clinic to help individuals with family law issues. In his final year, Williams began working with <a href="https://openlawlib.org/">Open Law Library</a>, and developed the Tribal Court of Appeals Project. The Tribal Court of Appeals Project works with Tribal Courts to create a database of information on their court cases to make the case law more accessible to the judges, practitioners, and public. The Project works with undergraduate students offering legal experience and college credits, in exchange for our Tribal Partners owning a free database.</p>
                <p>In addition to his various work experiences, Williams has made the Dean's List at UW Law School, he earned the best performance in Federal Indian Law, and he was the recipient of the Chief Justice Shirley Adrahamson Legacy Award. Attorney Williams is admitted to practice in the State of Wisconsin, and the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin.</p>
